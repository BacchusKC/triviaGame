# [Sunday Comics Trivia](https://bacchuskc.github.io/triviaGame/)

A JavaScript based game with timers. A lot of the problems I had to overcome with this project was making sure it looked perfect on mobile as well as PC. I designed the background myself by stiching together comics like a puzzle.

This app was created with the HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

To play, click start and you will have 20 seconds to answer that question before moving to the next one. Questions are randomized each play, and there are a total of ten questions each round.
